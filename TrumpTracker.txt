30. Leave troops in Afghanistan because it's such "a mess." Protect Israel. And increase U.S. military presence in the East and South China Seas.

31. Find an "out" clause in the Iran deal and then "totally" renegotiate the whole thing.

32. "I promise I will never be in a bicycle race. That I can tell you." (This promise is connected to criticism of Secretary of State John F. Kerry, who was injured while riding a bicycle amid the Iran negotiations.)

33. Refuse to call Iran's leader by his preferred title. "I guarantee you I will be never calling him the Supreme Leader... I'll say, 'Hey baby, how ya doing?' I will never call him the Supreme Leader."

34. Negotiate the release of all U.S. prisoners held in Iran before taking office. (Five hostages were recently released, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian; Trump has taken some credit for this.)

36. Find great generals -- like the next Gen. Patton or Gen. MacArthur -- and do not allow them to go onto television news shows to explain their military strategy: "I don't want my generals being interviewed, I want my generals kicking a--." Trump likes generals who are rough, foul-mouthed and beloved by their troops.


38. Fire "the corrupt and incompetent" leaders of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and dramatically reform the agency. Allow veterans to take their military identification card to any medical facility that accepts Medicaid patients to receive care. Embed satellite VA clinics in rural hospitals and underserved areas, and ensure than every VA hospital is permanently staffed with OBGYN doctors.

39. Invest more heavily in programs that help military veterans transition back to civilian life, including job training and placement services. Also increase funding for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injuries and mental health issues. Veterans who apply for a job at a VA facility will have five points added to their qualifying scores.


43. Aggressively challenge China's power in the world by declaring the country a currency manipulator, adopting a "zero tolerance policy on intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer" and cracking down on China's "lax labor and environmental standards."

44. Rather than throw the Chinese president a state dinner, buy him "a McDonald's hamburger and say we've got to get down to work."

45. Replace "free trade" with "fair trade." Gather together the "smartest negotiators in the world," assign them each a country and renegotiate all foreign trade deals.

46. Put billionaire hedge fund manager Carl Icahn in charge of trade negotiations with China and Japan, and pick an ambassador to Japan who is "a killer," unlike the current ambassador, Caroline Kennedy.

47. Tell Ford Motor Co.'s president that unless he cancels plans to build a massive plant in Mexico, the company will face a 35 percent tax on cars imported back into the United States. Trump is confident he can get this done before taking office. (Last year he incorrectly said this had already happened.)

48. Force Nabisco to once again make Oreos in the United States. And bully Apple into making its "damn computers" and other products here.

49. Impose new taxes on many imports into the country. Numbers thrown around have included 32 percent, 34 percent and 35 percent.

50. Grow the nation's economy by at least 6 percent.

51. Reduce the $18 trillion national debt by "vigorously eliminating waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government, ending redundant government programs and growing the economy to increase tax revenues."

52. Cut the budget by 20 percent by simply renegotiating.

53. Get rid of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

54. Simplify the U.S. tax code and reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to four. The highest earners would pay a 25-percent tax. The corporate tax rate would fall to 15 percent. Eliminate the "marriage penalty" for taxpayers and get rid of the alternate minimum tax.

55. No longer charge income tax to single individuals earning less than $25,000 per year or couples earning less than $50,000. These people will, however, be required to file a one-page form with the Internal Revenue Service that states: "I win."

57. Allow corporations a one-time window to transfer money being held overseas, charging a much-reduced 10 percent tax.

58. Get rid of most corporate tax loopholes or incentives, but continue to allow taxpayers to deduct mortgage interest and charitable donations from their taxes.

59. On his first day in office, Trump would get rid of gun-free zones at military bases and in schools.

60. Use "common sense" to fix the mental health system and prevent mass shootings. Find ways to arm more of the "good guys" like him who can take out the "sickos." Get rid of bans on certain types of guns and magazines so that "good, honest people" can own the guns of their choice.

61. Impose a minimum sentence of five years in federal prison for any violent felon who commits a crime using a gun, with no chance for parole or early release.

62. Fix the background check system used when purchasing guns to ensure states are properly uploading criminal and health records.

63. Allow concealed-carry permits to be recognized in all 50 states.

64. Sign an executive order calling for the death penalty for anyone found guilty of killing a police officer.

65. Provide more funding for police training.

66. And provide more funding for drug treatment, especially for heroin addicts.

67. On the first day in office, terminate President Obama's executive orders related to immigration. This includes getting rid of "sanctuary cities" that Trump says have become refuges for criminals.

68. Deport the almost 11 million immigrants illegally living in the United States.

69. Triple the number of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.

70. Continue to allow lowly paid foreign workers to come to the United States on temporary works visas because Trump says they are the only ones who want to pick grapes.

______________

Shred or rework trade agreements with Mexico, China and many other countries — and if companies leave for overseas, hit them with huge tariffs.

Deport, deport, deport — if not en masse, through a federal deportation force, at least expulsions in numbers far greater than the records President Obama already set.

Dismantle Obamacare, which has eliminated discrimination based on preexisting conditions, given 20 million additional Americans health insurance and, though you wouldn’t know it, bent the overall cost curve. What does it get replaced with? “Something terrific,” TBD.

Pass a huge tax cut, roughly double the one George W. Bush sponsored, that delivers a windfall to the wealthiest Americans and a relative paltry sum to the middle class, never mind the debt-inflating impact.

Bring back jobs, especially manufacturing jobs, that have fled the country over the past few decades.

Ensure that “the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end” — a pledge made in his nomination acceptance speech — by restoring law and order. Revive inner cities that he says have become hell holes.

Donald Trump: It's time to heal this divided nation


Some say he ran on nothing but his own overblown personality. Not so. Yes, he was supercharged by waging war against the media and the establishment and supposedly suffocating political correctness, but what distinguished him through the Republican primaries, and what he mostly stuck to through the general election, were a series of marquee pledges that will now become his governing agenda.

And he will have pressure to get those things accomplished given that the Senate and House both remain in Republican hands.

Build that wall along the United States’ southern border, he’s promised — with a prediction that he can get it done within 18 months. It’s an immensely complex endeavor, far harder than Trump’s simple sell, but now, if he doesn’t get it done, and doesn’t get our southern neighbor to pay for it, he’s failed.

Smash ISIS, though he hasn’t said how, and impose some form of extreme vetting test to keep out people who seem like they might be violent extremist Muslims.

Ensure that “the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end” — a pledge made in his nomination acceptance speech — by restoring law and order. How? Who knows. And revive inner cities that he says have become hell holes. How? Again, who knows.

Julian Castro: Trump win devastating to Hispanic community
And speaking of law and order, there’s that other promise: to make Hillary Clinton pay dearly for the crimes Trump is absolutely convinced, judgment of the FBI be damned, that she committed.

Just as Barack Obama entered the White House with a mandate for change and a Congress in his corner, Donald Trump has his own. He will now be expected to accomplish huge things.

“We will have so much winning if I get elected that you may get bored with the winning.”

Over to you, Mr. President-elect.

"End the war on coal."

Meet with Homeland Security officials and generals to begin securing the southern border.
"Notify all countries that refuse to take back dangerous illegal immigrants who have committed crimes in this country that they will lose access to our visa programs if they continue to do so."
Convene his top generals and inform them they have 30 days to come up with a plan to stop ISIS.
Fix the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Call the heads of major companies who are moving operations oversea to inform them that they'll face 35 percent tariffs.
"Contact countries and say…'Folks, we love protecting you, we want to continue to protect you but you're not living up to the bargain'…They're not paying what they're supposed to be paying—which is very little, by the way."
"Defend the unborn."
"Withdraw from TPP."
"Start taking care of our…military."
Suspend Syrian refugee resettlement.
"Notify our NAFTA partners of my intention to renegotiate the deal."
"Designate China as a currency manipulator."
"Direct every agency in government to begin identifying all wasteful job-killing regulations, and they are going to be removed."
"Get rid of gun-free zones [in] schools" and "military bases"—which would require repealing a 25-year-old federal law. ("My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There's no more gun-free zones.")
"Ask Congress to pass 'Kate's Law'—named for Kate Steinle—to ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry receive strong mandatory minimum sentences."
Learn the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas.
It's shaping up to be a busy day! Hillary Clinton, by contrast, has made only a few day-one promises, none of which is as concrete as shaking down European heads of state:

"Tackle the gun lobby to try to reduce the outrageous number of people who are dying from gun violence in our country."
"Reach out to Republicans and say, 'This is your chance to help millions of families and show that your party, the party of Lincoln, is better than Donald Trump.'"
"Work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II."
